# rupa's TADA68 layout

i've swapped the lufa-ms bootloader for caterina

most everything is in my userspace dir

console mode is on, and there's barely any room left!

* win/alt -> alt/cmd
* alt/fn -> fn/alt
* grave escape, with alt override
* caps is another fn key, CAPS on fn-rctl

fn layer:
  * no wasd arrows
  * rotate mute/vol
  * backlight -> breathing, step, toggle
  * swap home and ins
  * unicode chars sprinkled around
  * script mode!
  * (one-shot) right versions of shift/ctl/alt/gui (not working quite right yet)
