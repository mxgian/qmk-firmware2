### Rotary Encoder and VIA Features:
-   Fully emappable left encoder controls volume up/down/mute. Right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN.
-   Allows for  live remapping of per-layer rotary encoder functions in VIA.
-   VIA support included by default.
-   This fixes the Keyhive left bottom row offset issue in VIA. You will need to import sofle.json in VIA.

-   Custom macro key in VIA for moving windows to other monitors in Windows, which is fully compatible with rotary encoders.

### Tap and Other Features:

-   Double tap layers to stay on a layer instead of momentary push.
-   Adds key combo functionality.
-   Symmetric modifiers (CMD/Super, Alt/Opt, Ctrl, Shift).

## Using with VIA

-   After flashing, in VIA make sure to Import Keymap, which is "sofle VIA keymap.json". This will alow VIA to recognize the updated layout and custom functions. VIA will not auto-recognize the keyboard with this firmware because of the necessary customization.
-   Go to Save+Load to Load Saved Layout. You can import my own layout "sofle VIA layout.json" or just use the Keymap tab to assign your own keys. Having another keyboard connected can be handy for doing this step.
-   It is a good idea to Save Current Layout after you decide on your mapping.
