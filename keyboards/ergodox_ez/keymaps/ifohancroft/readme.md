# IFo Hancroft's ErgoDox EZ Layout

- Layer 0: A Standard ANSI QWERTY Layer.
- Layer 1: A Gaming Layer. It replaces the Backspace with a Space, and the Dash with a 6, so you can play CS:GO without needing to lift your right hand from the mouse.
- Layer 2: A function layer. It contains the F1-F12 keys and arrows on WASD.
- Layer 3: A CAD Layer. It is basically a mirrored version of the right hand side, so you can use CAD without needing to lift your right hand from the the mouse.

This keymap also does the following:

- Sets the polling rate of the keyboard to 1ms
- Sets the debounce time to 5ms
- NKRO (Forced on)
- Disables:
    - Mouse Key
    - Extra Key
    - Unicode
    - Swap Hands
